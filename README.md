yarn
====

Yarn is a highly threaded programming language designed with the goal of enabling development of complex applications in less than 2 hours.
Yarn is a semi-compiled language (similar to java or compiled python) which has a compiler, written in C, called loom, and an interpreter, written in C++, called weave.


Yarn is in very early development, so you won't find much here yet.

Current milestones are:

- Pre compiler (loom)
  - Lexer  (shed) *
  - Parser (pick)
  - Bytecode compiler (bat)

- Lightweight interpreter (weave)
  - components TBD

* indicates current milestone.
